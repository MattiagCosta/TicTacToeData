# About

Repository containing some data about my study of Tic-Tac-Toe.

The data can be found in [Source&Data/Data](Source&Data/Data).

----------
The repository contains the source files I used to get the data too.

## [TicTacToe.hpp](Source&Data/TicTacToe.hpp)

C++ library with some useful constants and functions reguarding the study of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Implementations in [TicTacToe.cpp](Source&Data/TicTacToe.cpp).

### Checking attributes

When a function is called, attributes aren't checked if valid. The user can check if the values are valid using the functions "Check*" before calling the desired function.

### The info attribute of Get*AtKnownDepth functions

It tells the function which kind of data to get. Combine the flags defined as macros and pass it to the function throught the info attribute.

>It has been three years since I first began this project but I definitely worked less than three years on this. After so many tries and mistakes *(lexical and logical mistakes and so many other I can't even remember of, especially language and spelling mistakes - a lot English mistakes)*, I hope this time will be the last analisy I make; I won't be surprised if someone finds errors and mistakes here too. I learnt a lot during these years. Someone else will continue this project if needed. I might continue the project if I will fell like to, but as of today, I probably won't. I can feel the heavy weight I have been carrying all these years finally getting lighter I am leaving a plain text file with everything I think it is important about the project; I will update it later. - *MGC*
